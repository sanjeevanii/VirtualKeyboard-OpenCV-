# VirtualKeyboard-OpenCV-
I made this project- an OpenCV Virtual Keyboard that lets you type without touching a physical keyboard. It uses MediaPipe to track fingertip positions and detects key presses through hover and tap gestures. The interface is built with OpenCV, making it interactive and contactless.
